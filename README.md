# Changes in this fork
- Added filter for first reported position above max limit. 
  - This prevents the table from moving to lowest position when plugging everything in.
- Some code cleanup
- Added 3D Printed case, see below

## 3D printed case on Thingiverse

The case contains 4 buttons. Two are for manually rasing and lowering the desk. 
The other two are to directly move the desk to fixed positions (sitting / standing)

The PCB sandwich consists of the original IKEA board, Arduino Nano 3, a custom board containing the other components.
Lastly the black box is a DC/DC converter converting the desk power (24V) to 5V for the Arduino.

A simple LIN slave attached to the stock controller board adds two memory buttons.
